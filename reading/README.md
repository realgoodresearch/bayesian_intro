## Papers  

We have put together a few papers that were particularly useful and/or interesting to us. These are organised in `./reading/papers/` into "fundamentals" and "case studies". The papers on fundamentals cover the Bayesian workflow, model checking, specifying priors, model selection, and others. The case study papers provide examples of Bayesian analyses that were particularly interesting to us and relevant to some of the concepts discussed in the course.
