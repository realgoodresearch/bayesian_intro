# Our first Bayesian models
> Computer Lab Excercises

Our very first model will be a simple one: Estimating the mean from a sample of a continuous variable. This will help us focus on the basics of running a Bayesian model in Stan without getting bogged down with too much statistical complexity. Then, we will build on this basic model and workflow for more complex models.  

Stan is a very well documented programming language for Bayesian inference with lots of resources to help you along. Here are some places to look for help and deeper dives:

## Activities  

1. Model of the mean  
2. Exploring posteriors, likelihoods, and priors   
3. Gaussian (normal) linear regression  
4. Out-of-sample cross-validation  

## Pre-requisites  

Students will need good programming skills in R and a basic understanding
of linear regression to be successful in this course. 

You will need to install the following free open-source software prior to doing the practical exercises:  

- R and <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank">RStudio</a> or <a href="https://positron.posit.co/" target="_blank">Positron</a> (or your favourite R IDE)   
- <a href="https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html" target="_blank">CmdStanR and its dependencies</a>
