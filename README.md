# bayesian_intro: A primer on Bayesian statistics for applied research

**Author: Doug Leasure**

This two-day course provides a practical and accessible introduction to Bayesian statistics
for applied research in any field. Students will benefit from a combination of lectures and
discussion to explore fundamental concepts unlocking the potential to design bespoke
statistical analyses based on your data and hypotheses as well as practical exercises to
gain hands-on experience implementing Bayesian models using free and open-source
software. The course is designed as a springboard to overcome the steepest part of the
Bayesian learning curve with an immersive two-day deep-dive.  

Students can expect to gain a working understanding of Bayes theorem (i.e. likelihoods,
priors, and posterior probability distributions) and implementation of Markov Chain Monte
Carlo for Bayesian model fitting. The course will cover common probability distributions and
the know-how to choose between them when designing bespoke models as well as a solid
foundation in model validation techniques for high quality research. These concepts will be
reinforced through practical lab exercises to gain experience implementing Bayesian models
using R and Stan software. Students will be challenged through interactive group
discussions to formalise their own mental models (i.e. hypotheses) into bespoke statistical
models that can be used to confront these models with data.

Students will have the opportunity to schedule a follow-up Bayesian surgery appointment
(30 mins in-person or remote) for one-to-one engagement (or small groups, as preferred)
with the course instructor to answer burning questions that remain and/or to troubleshoot
technical challenges related to their own research applications.  

**Pre-requisites:** Students will need good programming skills in R and a basic understanding
of linear regression to be successful in this course.
